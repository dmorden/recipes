Lemon Cake

1 Lemon cake mix
4 eggs
2/3 cup of vegetable oil
1 teaspoon of lemon flavoring
1 box of lemon jello
1 cup water

Glaze
1 cup powdered suger
Lemon Juice

Boil water in the microwave until boiling (2 min).  Add lemon jello to the 1 cup of water.  Put in refrigerator to cool.  Give jello time to cool before starting cake. It helps to just add jello mix to hot water from the tap.  In a large mixing bowl, add eggs one at a time to the lemon mix.  Beat well after each egg.  Add oil and lemon flavoring.  Slowly add the cooled jello and water mixture.  Mix well. 

Poor into a greased and floured 9x13" pan.  Bake at 350 for 25 to 30 min or until the cake pulls away from the pan.  Take out of oven and poke holes in the cake every few inches with a knife or fork.

Mix together 1 cup of powdered suger and enough lemon juice to make a thick syrup (ie not that much) and pour over hot cake.  Let cool and eat.
